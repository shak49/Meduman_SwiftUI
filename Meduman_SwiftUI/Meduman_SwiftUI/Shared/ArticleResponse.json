The flu:</p><ul><li>Is linked to serious infections like pneumonia</li><li>Can make existing health problems worse (for example, long-term heart or lung disease)</li><li>Can lead to hospitalization or death</li></ul><p>Flu vaccines can help prevent people from getting sick with the flu — and lower the risk of hospitalization and death for people who do get sick.</p><p>The flu spreads easily from person to person.

After you get vaccinated, it takes about 2 weeks for your body to develop protection against the flu. That’s why it’s a good idea to get a flu vaccine before flu starts to spread in your community.</p><p>Even if you don’t get a flu vaccine by the end of October, getting a vaccine later can still protect you from the flu.
